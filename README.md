# FashionEcommerce
We have developed an online fashion ecommerce app using android, firebase, java. 
This whole project is developed in Android studio. Here java programming language is used for the field valida on and also XML language for the transferring of data.
To manage real time customer data , firebase technology is used. Online fashion shopping applicaon is an Android project. 
It allows the user to select and buy the products of different categories from the app store. To run the project you will need Android Studio.
This whole project has only one concept, that is to provide a wide range of products to their customers. You can select any type of product you want to buy. 
You have to provide the proper shipping details. We have 2 different logins. One for Admin and another for customers. 
Admin can add products like adding image , price and product description,etc. These changes will get reflected in the firebase console immediately and customers can 
buy items and can manage items in the cart. Different categories like clothing, footwear, accessories, bags, etc are created. 
You can select any products you want to buy and put them into the cart. And then ship it at the end by providing your shipping details.For payment mode, we have a 
cash on delivery option as of now.
In order to run the project, just download and install the apk file of our app. App will run on any android device.
